# GrassRMA - GRAph-based Sparse Vector Search with Reducing Memory Accesses
Winning NeurIPS' Competition Track: Big ANN, Practical Vector Search Challenge. (Sparse Track)

Instead of using the Inverted Index, we use the Graph-based ANNS method to solve the sparse vector retrieval problem, resulting in a 50x speed up than baseline.
